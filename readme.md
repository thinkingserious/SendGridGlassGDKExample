This code is not production ready. It is meant to help you integrate quickly with SendGrid when developing for Google Glass natively. You will need to incorporate error handling and testing. 

There is a companion blog post, yet to published, that walks through the entire process to build this app from scratch. When it's live, I'll post the link here.

View a demo of this Glassware in action on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/84ZP6Pi68nE).

## Usage

This Glassware allows you to send email via [SendGrid](http://www.sendgrid.com) (you will need at least a free account) through Glass by adding an additional menu item to the Home card. 

Start the Glassware by saying "OK Glass, send an email." from the Home menu or tap on the home menu and choose "send an email".

Next, you will be prompted to speak whom you would like the email to go to. Then you will provide a subject and body.

Once complete, you will be able to preview your message and edit if necessary. If all is good, tap Send.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with this example is to:

* Clone the repo
* Modify the UtilsDEFAULT.java file as described in the file
* Compile and run the code

## Info & Help

If you create something cool with this code, let us know so we can include you in the [SendGrid Developer Community](http://sendgrid.com/developers/developers).

Please let me know how I can improve this tutorial with a pull request or open an issue. Thanks!
